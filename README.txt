Hello and welcome to a simple stock ticker tracker, so far it gives description of selected ticker for given date range and it generates a bollinger plot.

More features to come!

modify the ticker list to include your own picks, or modify the code (line19) with your own text file
Make sure to have the required packages installed(yfinance, pandas, cufflink / plotly, streamlit.)
